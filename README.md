# Pockest Helper

## What is this?

This is a [Chrome Extension](chrome://extensions/) that tracks and automatically cares for [Street Fighter Pockest Monsters](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/minigame). It is a passion project and is still in early development.

## FAQ

### Will installing this extension midway through a monster's life cause issue?

The extensions will not enact any changes on your behalf until you click the "AUTO-CARE" button. Please make sure you have set the proper options before clicking this button or it may affect the outcome of your final monster.

### Why didn't I get the monster I selected?

The requirements for specific monsters are quite complex. If attempting a run for a specific monster using the preset you should refrain from manually taking any actions. This includes matching, curing, etc. The extension follows the [Pockest Guide on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3003515624) qutie closely so it's a great reference if you would like to better understand how things work so you can manually pilot the tool.

### The app or a feature is broken for me. What can I do?

Sorry about that! Feel free to join the [Pockest Guide Discord](https://discord.gg/492bdzBDu) if you have any questions or feedback. There is a dedicated `#pockest-helper` channel. Also please keep in mind that testing some features/fixes may take collaboration and/or multiple days because verifying functionality often requires specific game events.
