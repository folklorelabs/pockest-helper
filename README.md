## Usage

There are two modes: "Manual" and "Auto-Plan".

#### Manual

This mode is straight forward enough. Use the checkboxes to mark the activities you'd like the script to perform, update the "frequencies" for how often you'd like them performed, and then click "Start Helping" to kick things off.

#### Auto-Plan

This mode requires minimal effort. Select the character you'd like to target, click "Start Helping", and the script will take care of everything else.
